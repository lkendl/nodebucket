<div class="about-txt-container">
  <p class="text">
    Nodebucket was developed out of the undeniable need to help certain paper salespeople stay organized at the country's #1 paper company, Dunder Mifflin. As a directive from HR, the nodebucket application was theorized to help employees stay focused on their individual tasks, no matter when and how often distractions arose (which was often). The proposed nodebucket project had one major complication, though. The branch did not have a web developer, nor could they afford to hire a professional.

  <p class="text">
    Due to his undying loyalty and dedication to his company, Dwight took on the nodebucket challenge. Without hesitation (and with his own funds), Dwight enrolled at Bellevue University online to learn the necessary skills he needed to create nodebucket. Between tending his farm, remaining the top salesman at his job, and running his B&B, Dwight earned his Bachelor's in Web Development. Shortly after, Dwight fulfilled his duty of creating nodebucket in September 2022.

    Nodebucket's design is an homage to author J.K. Rowling's fantasy novel series, Harry Potter. An avid Harry Potter fan, nodebucket developer Dwight Schrute identifies with Gryffindor's traits of courage, determination, and bravery (often to the point of recklessness). Nodebucket's theme of red and gold is inspired by House Gryffindor.
